# Pygame Projects
This repository contains four Python projects developed using Pygame library:

Golden Orbs Game: Collect golden orbs to earn money in this fun game.

Space Game: Similar to old-style space shooter games, you navigate through space and destroy enemy planes and ships using lasers. As you progress through levels, the difficulty increases.

Maze Game: Navigate a simple maze with a ball using arrow keys. When you reach the end, you'll be greeted with a surprise.

Box Game: Keep a ball from falling by bouncing it off a box at the bottom of the screen. As you hit the boxes above, they disappear.

Each project is implemented with Python's Pygame library, and they demonstrate different game mechanics and features. Enjoy playing them!
